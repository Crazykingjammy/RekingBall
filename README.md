# RekingBall
Small mini game made with Unity to learn about WebGL and Github.

Within this repository, I focused on two main areas of Proof of Concepting and Production:

#### 1. Scriptables


The scriptables code have been imported from a project Created by Chad Riddle, and as he states - none of those ideas are his own. 


The link to his github project:

#### 2. Game System Tools


Ive started breaking down some of the new system tools that are to be used with THOT. Ideally, these tools are robust enough so they can be imported on any game. But that is currenly the work in progress.

There are a few systems currently implemented 

##### A. Library System 


##### B. Sta ck Editor
